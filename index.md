### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because both the code and output are things that can be applied in our everyday lives. This lab calculates the unit price of a pizza based on the size and price of the pizza. This same concept of calculation can be applied to different things which can help find the best price/deal of that item.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it had code which led to the output of either winning or losing the game based on user input. This lab made me realize how some games must have a large amount of code needed to satisfy multiple possibilities.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was another favorite because I was able to transform written code in Visual Studio code into an output gif file which showed a changing gradient of multiple colors. This was the first lab that had the output have multiple images combined into one.
